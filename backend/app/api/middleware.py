"""Request context and access logging.

**Pure ASGI, not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`.** The convenient base class buffers the
response body to hand it to you as one object, which for a Server-Sent Events
endpoint means the stream arrives all at once at the end — the exact failure the
`X-Accel-Buffering` header elsewhere exists to prevent. Forty lines of ASGI
avoids it entirely.

The request id is bound into `structlog.contextvars`, so every log line for the
rest of the request carries it without a single call site passing it along. That
machinery was already wired up in `logging.py` — `merge_contextvars` has always
been in the processor chain — and nothing had ever bound anything to it.
