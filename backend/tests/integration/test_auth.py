"""The auth seam, on and off.

Real RSA keys and real signatures — only the JWKS *fetch* is stubbed, because
the alternative is standing up an HTTP server to serve two constants. Everything
that decides whether a request is authorized runs exactly as it would in
production.

The route under test is defined here rather than borrowed from the app, and
that is deliberate. What these tests are about is `get_current_user` — every
assertion below is about a signature, a claim or a status code, and none of
them is about any particular endpoint. Pinning them to a real route would mean
this file breaks whenever that route moves, which teaches you to edit the
security tests while changing something else entirely.
