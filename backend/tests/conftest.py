"""Test-wide environment setup.

**The environment block below runs at import time and must stay above every
`app` import.** Three module-level globals are built from settings when
`app.config` and `app.db` are first imported — `settings`, `engine`, and
`SessionFactory` — and there is no later hook that can redirect them at a
database. Move an `app` import above this and the suite quietly runs against
your development database.

Only the environment lives here. The fixtures that *build* a database are in
`tests/integration/conftest.py`, one directory down, and that placement is
load-bearing rather than tidy: an autouse session fixture applies to every test
below the conftest that defines it, so keeping it here would mean `tests/unit`
and `tests/structure` could not run without Postgres. They have no business
needing it, and the pre-commit hook runs exactly those two.
